 * real playlists before writing this) — so matching works from the title
 * text and duration alone, the same way a person would eyeball it.
 *
 * Three things make this better than a plain "best fuzzy score wins":
 *
 * 1. **Every identity a file has is compared, not just its tags.** A track
 *    whose tags were never cleaned still has a filename, and one that *was*
 *    cleaned still carries its pre-clean "stem | | artist | | title | | year"
 *    searchable backup (see `build_searchable_backup` in files.rs) — often
 *    the only place the original YouTube-ish spelling survives.
 * 2. **Mix/version awareness.** "Song (Artist Remix)" and "Song" are
 *    different recordings; edit distance barely notices, so the distinctive
 *    part of a version qualifier is scored separately and can veto a match.
 * 3. **Global one-to-one assignment.** Each library file can back at most one
 *    playlist entry, so two near-identical entries can't both claim it — the
 *    stronger pairing wins and the weaker one falls through to its own next
 *    best candidate.

/**
 * An inverted index over the collection, built once per run.
 *
 * Scoring is exact but not free, and scanning every track for every entry is
 * what actually costs the seconds: a 70-entry playlist against 4,149 tracks
 * is 290k full comparisons. Almost all of those are between a playlist entry
 * and a track with no word in common, which can never score anywhere near a
 * match. This narrows each entry to the tracks that share something with it.
 *
 * Two kinds of key, because exact-token overlap alone would miss misspellings:
 *
 * - the **whole token** ("brejcha"), which catches everything that agrees on
 *   any word;
 * - the token's **first three characters** ("bre"), which catches a
 *   misspelling of that word, since typos very rarely land in the opening
 *   letters ("disturbia" / "disturbya" both bucket under "dis").
 *
 * **What this guarantees.** Measured against the exhaustive scan over a
 * 4,149-track corpus, the shortlist never changes a status, an assignment,
 * or any candidate at or above `AMBIGUOUS_THRESHOLD` — i.e. nothing that
 * decides a match. What it can drop are alternates scraping the
 * `FLOOR_THRESHOLD` bottom (the worst observed loss scored 0.31), which
 * exist only to pad the carousel and are noise by construction: a track
 * sharing neither a whole word nor a word-opening with the entry is not a
 * plausible match. `ytMatchIndex.test.ts` asserts that contract, typos
 * included, rather than the stronger equality it does not hold.
