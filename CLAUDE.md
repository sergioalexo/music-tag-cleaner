# Music Tag Cleaner — AI working notes

Read this first; it exists so you don't have to explore the repo to get oriented.
The owner is a DJ (Rekordbox / Serato / Traktor) and often calls this app
"Media Fetch" — that is a *different* repo; tag/table/AI-Clean/YouTube-import
requests mean this one.

## Stack & commands
- Tauri 2 desktop app: React + TypeScript + Tailwind (`src/`), Rust (`src-tauri/`).
- `npm test` — vitest (TS). `cargo test` in `src-tauri/` — Rust tests.
- `npm run build` — `tsc && vite build` (type-check gate).
- `npm run tauri dev` — the only way to see the UI. **The app does not run in a
  plain browser** (every Tauri `invoke` throws), so don't try `npm run dev` + a
  browser to verify UI.
- Release: push a `v*` tag → `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds + signs all
  three platforms into a **draft** release (~14 min) that is published by hand.
  Bump version in `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.

| Optional external tools (yt-dlp, FFmpeg, Demucs, Ollama, Claude CLI) | `src/pages/ComponentsPage.tsx` + matching `commands/*.rs` |
| Duplicates, convert, stems, USB, Rekordbox cues, backup | `commands/duplicates.rs`, `convert.rs`, `demucs.rs`, `usb.rs`, `rekordbox_import.rs`, `backup*.rs` |
| v1.0 accounts/payments (not built; waiting on owner's Phase 0) | `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql`, ROADMAP "Roadmap — v1.0" |

## ROADMAP.md — don't read it whole (~2000 lines)
It is the changelog + plan. Numbered `### N.` sections, newest last. To orient:
`grep -n "^##\|^### " ROADMAP.md`, then read only the section you need. When you
ship something, append a new numbered section in the same style (what/why/how
verified) — that's the project's convention.

## Hard-won rules (don't relearn these)
- **No drag gestures in the YouTube-import search dock.** The webview starts a
  native content drag that runs a modal loop and freezes the renderer.
  `draggable={false}` is not enough; you'd need `-webkit-user-drag: none` on the
  row *and every descendant*. Use buttons.
- Column reordering is pointer-event based, not HTML5 drag, for the same reason.
- DJ tag semantics: Rekordbox reads **Original Artist**; Serato/Traktor need
  **Comment**. Track ID lives in `TXXX:TRACKID` (`TagData.trackId`), never in
  Track Number (TRCK = playlist order in Rekordbox/Serato).
- "Raw fields" = `TagData.allFields` (lofty's full frame dump); `raw:` prefix in
  `settings.clearFields`.
- Claude CLI: the copy bundled with the Claude desktop app is usually **not
  signed in** for standalone use; errors come back as `is_error: true` in the
  JSON body, not via exit code. The native installer (`irm .../install.ps1`)
  puts `claude.exe` under `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin`, which is not on `PATH`
  by default and is not one of the locations `find_claude()` checks yet.
- Demucs runs as `python -m demucs` in the user's own Python; never pass `-j` on CUDA.
- Large collections (4000+ files) are normal. Anything that renders one element
  per library track, or runs per-keystroke work over the whole library, must be
  virtualized / memoized / deferred.
- Heavy per-row components (e.g. `<audio>` elements) must not be mounted for
  hundreds of rows at once.

## Style
- Comments explain *why* (often the bug that forced the design); keep that
  density when editing nearby code.
- Tailwind utility classes + shared `src/components/ui.tsx` (`Button`, `Card`,
  `CardHeader`, `cn`). Icons from `lucide-react`.
- Rust commands return `Result<T, String>` with user-readable messages; TS side
  surfaces them via `notify(String(e), "error")`.
- Validate against the owner's real library/playlists when possible, not only fixtures.
